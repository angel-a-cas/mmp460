            Arepa, Sugar Cake and Grilled Cheese 
            A bilingual (Spanish-English) children’s book, written by Yeimilee Marcano, with assistance from Angel Castillo & illustrated by Jayveon Boland. 
            Imani is excited for her first day of school, but her excitement fades when a classmate’s hurtful words make her question where she belongs. With the comforting aroma of her mom’s warm arepas and her dad’s sweet sugar cakes filling the air, her parents remind her that her heritage is something to celebrate. Through the joy of food and shared stories, Imani and her classmates learn a powerful lesson: no matter where her family comes from, she belongs.
            The first thousand books will have included the sticker sheet
            To be released in Summer 2025. Please email us at [ImaniLuciaandConrad@email.com] if you would like to pre-order or schedule a reading at your library or bookshop.

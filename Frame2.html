        <p>Children who read this story can see themselves both reflected and inspired by Imani’s experience. Creating stories like this one offers children a unique opportunity to learn about their communities and strengthen their cultural bonds with their families. 
The plot of “Arepa, Sugar Cake, and Grilled Cheese” teaches children the concept of belonging and helps them develop a sense of their rights and responsibilities as members of their community.  Our goal was to write a book that could foster a lasting and intimate connection with your kids. It can also serve as a vehicle for imparting values, life lessons, and cherished family stories. Through storytelling, you can foster their love for reading and imagination. 
We created this page to share resources that can be useful for multicultural and immigrant families, as well as their allies. 
Children aged 4-6 may be too young to fully understand their legal rights, but they can begin to exercise fundamental American values like freedom of speech, inclusion, and fairness in age-appropriate ways. Here’s how:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Freedom of Speech & Expression – Encouraging them to share their thoughts, feelings, and ideas in conversations, classroom discussions, and creative activities like drawing and storytelling.</li>
        <li>Right to Education – Actively participating in school, asking questions, and engaging in learning experiences that help them grow.</li>
        <li>Right to Be Heard – Speaking up when something is unfair, like telling a teacher if they or a friend are being treated poorly.</li>
        <li>Right to Play – Engaging in play with peers, learning cooperation, and understanding the importance of fairness and inclusion.</li>
        <li>Right to Be Treated with Respect – Learning and practicing kindness, respect for others' differences, and standing up against exclusion or bullying.</li>
        <li>Right to Safety & Protection – Understanding basic safety rules, knowing who to go to for help, and recognizing that adults should keep them safe.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By teaching children these concepts in everyday situations, they begin to develop a sense of their rights and responsibilities as members of their community.
          A portion of the proceeds for this book go to United We Dream () a non-profit focused on the rights of immigrants in the US. Their site is full of invaluable resources and we encourage you to learn more about their mission at
